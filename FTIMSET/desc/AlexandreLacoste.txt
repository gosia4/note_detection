A Supervised Classification Algorithm For Note Onset Detection

The most promising candidate dataset we found was a publicly-available collection from Pierre
Leveau [26]. Unfortunately, this dataset was too small and restricted for our purposes, mainly
focusing on monophonic pieces.
We chose to annotate our own musical pieces. To make it possible to share our annotations with
others, we selected the publicly-available non-annotated “Ballroom” dataset from ISMIR 2004 as
a source for our waveforms. The “Ballroom” dataset is composed of 698 wav files of approximately
30 seconds each. Annotating the complete dataset would be too time consuming and was not
necessary to train our model. We therefore annotated 59 random segments of 10 seconds each.
Most of them are complex polyphonic with singing, mixed with pitched and noisy percussion.
The labels were manually annotated using a matlab program with GUI constructed by the
first author to allow for precise annotation of wav files. The “Ballroom” annotations as well
as the matlab interface are available on request from the first author or at the following page:
